This program accepts an integer from the user and calculates the fibonacci sequence up to that number. 
When started the program will ask how many elements the user would like to see. 

When presented with an integer between 1 and 47 the program will calculate the fibonacci sequence and store it in an array. It will
then print the nth (with n being the integer the user selected) fibonacci number and print the array starting at 1 on the line below

When presented with an integer greater than 47 the program will state that the fibonacci number cannot be held in 32 bits and will
prompt the user for a new integer.
When presented with an integer less than 0 the program will state that the fibonacci number cannot be held in 32 bits and will prompt
the user for a new integer.

When presented with 0 the program will terminate.
